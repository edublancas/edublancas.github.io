Experience
----------
**Columbia University (Deparment of Statistics)** \hfill New York, NY

*Research Assistant (Advisor: Liam Paninski)* \hfill Sep 2017 - Dec 2018

* Maintainer of [YASS](https://github.com/paninski-lab/yass): an open source spike sorting library. Responsible for managing the project with the internal team and external community
* Worked with the research team to turn YASS old codebase into a tested, organized and documented Python library
* Develop high-performance algorithms for processing Larger-than-Memory datasets (NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn)
* Use Deep Learning (CNNs) for neural activity detection and classification (TensorFlow, Keras)

**Krieger** \hfill Mexico City, MX

*Lead Backend Engineer* \hfill Jun 2016 - Aug 2017

* Oversaw backend development across projects to ensure code quality, performance and reliability
* Developed internal software tools that are used in several ongoing projects (input validation, software versioning, deployment, user permissions). These tools have reduced development time and increased team's productivity
* REST Web Services development using Python and Google Cloud

**University of Chicago (Center for Data Science and Public Policy)** \hfill Chicago, IL

*Data Science Fellow (Advisor: Rayid Ghani)* \hfill May 2015 - Jun 2016

* Developed a Machine Learning model using spatiotemporal data for the City of Cincinnati to identify properties at risk of building code violations. Worked with more than 50GB of data.
* Designed a predictive model for Infonavit (largest mortgage  provider in Mexico) to predict home abandonment. Worked with more than 100GB of data
* Communicated data analysis results to non-technical audience
