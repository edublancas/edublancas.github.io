Experience
----------
**Columbia University (Grossman Center for the Statistics of Mind)** \hfill 
New York, NY

*Research Assistant (Advisor: Liam Paninski)* \hfill Sep 2017 - Present

* Mantainer of [YASS](https://github.com/paninski-lab/yass): an automated Python spike sorting library built on top of SciPy, scikit-learn and TensorFlow
* Apply Machine Learning methods to improve automated spike sorting

**Krieger** \hfill Mexico City, MX

*Lead Backend Engineer* \hfill Jun 2016 - Aug 2017

* Oversaw backend development across projects to ensure code quality, performance and reliability
* Developed internal software tools that are used in several ongoing projects (input validation, software versioning, deployment, user permissions). These tools have reduced development time and increased team's productivity
