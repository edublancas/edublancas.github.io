Education
---------

**Columbia University** \hfill  Aug 2017 - Dec 2018 (Expected)

M.S. in Data Science. Fulbright Scholar.

Coursework: Computer Systems, Machine Learning, Probabilistic Programming, Robustness and Security in ML, Applied Deep Learning.\newline

**Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM)** \hfill Aug 2016 - Jun 2017

Graduate Certificate in Applied Statistics (one-year program of graduate coursework)

Coursework: Statistical Inference, Sampling, Multivariate Analysis, Regression Models and Bayesian Inference.\newline

Experience
----------
**Columbia University (Deparment of Statistics)** \hfill New York, NY

*Research Assistant (Advisor: Liam Paninski)* \hfill Sep 2017 - Dec 2018

* Maintainer of [YASS](https://github.com/paninski-lab/yass): an open source library for Computational Neuroscience
* Develop high-performance algorithms for processing Larger-than-Memory datasets (NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn)
* Improve existing code: optimization using benchmarking and profiling tools, parallelization using the multiprocessing library and NumPy parallel operations
* Use Deep Learning for neural activity detection and classification (TensorFlow, Keras), GPU training using Google Compute Engine
* Worked with the research team to turn YASS old codebase into a tested, organized and documented Python library

**Krieger** \hfill Mexico City, MX

*Lead Backend Engineer* \hfill Jun 2016 - Aug 2017

* Oversaw backend development across projects to ensure code quality, performance and reliability
* Developed internal software tools that are used in several ongoing projects (input validation, software versioning, deployment, user permissions). These tools have reduced development time and increased team's productivity
* Developed web services using Python (Flask) and deployed them using Google App Engine, Cloud Datastore and Cloud Storage
* Engineered a data pipeline to perform entity resolution using Apache Airflow

**University of Chicago (Center for Data Science and Public Policy)** \hfill Chicago, IL

*Data Science Fellow (Advisor: Rayid Ghani)* \hfill May 2015 - Jun 2016

* Developed a Machine Learning model for the City of Cincinnati to identify properties at risk of building code violations. 50GB+ of data
* Designed a predictive model for Infonavit (largest mortgage  provider in Mexico) to predict home abandonment. 100GB+ of data
* Both pipelines (ETL, feature extracion, model training and model selection) developed using Amazon EC2, S3 and RDS.
* Communicated data analysis results to non-technical audience
