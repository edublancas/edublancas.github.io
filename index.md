# Hello, this is Eduardo Blancas Reyes

<img src="edublancas.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 30%"></img>

I'm a Mechatronics Engineer (that's what my diploma says) born and raised in Mexico City. I've been doing iOS development for a while and now I turned to Data Science. I enjoy applying my technical skills to problems with social impact.

Like the time that I helped to [stop a 9.3 million fraud](http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/14/bringing-down-the-mexican-mafia-how-mexican-hackers-stopped-a-93-million-fraud/). Or when I worked in a project to understand the [causes of home abandonment in Mexico](http://dssg.uchicago.edu/2015/08/13/infonavit-abandonment.html) with some cool folks.

I co-founded a (failed) startup and worked in the [Center for Data Science and Public Policy](http://dsapp.org/) at The University of Chicago.

I'm currently learning stats at [IIMAS](http://www.iimas.unam.mx/) and working as Backend Engineer at [Krieger](http://krieger.mx).

## Find me on the internet

I sometimes write in [Medium](https://medium.com/@edublancas), but I'm always [tweeting](https://twitter.com/edublancas). If you want to talk about work, check out my [LinkedIn profile](https://mx.linkedin.com/in/edublancas) or download my [resume](resume/resume.pdf). I have some videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/edublancas/videos) and code on [Github](https://github.com/edublancas/).
