Hi, this is Eduardo. I am currently a Data Scientist at Fidelity Investments. Before that, I obtained a **M.S in Data Science at Columbia University**, sponsored by Fulbright and CONACYT where I worked as Research Assistant in [Professor Liam Paninki's Lab](http://grossmancenter.columbia.edu/) in the Neuroscience and Statistics department.

Before moving to NYC, I did the **Applied Statistics** program at **UNAM-IIMAS** and worked as *Lead Backend Engineer* at [Krieger](https://krieger.mx/) in Mexico City.

I also spent a wonderful time in Chicago. I was a **Data Science Fellow** in the [Center for Data Science and Public Policy](http://dsapp.org/) at **University of Chicago** where I worked on Data Science projects applied to [urban revitalization](http://dssg.uchicago.edu/2015/08/13/infonavit-abandonment.html).

Before that, I obtained a B.S. degree in **Mechatronics Engineering** from **Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey**. I was doing iOS development back then and had the opportunity to work on some amazing [initiatives](http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/14/bringing-down-the-mexican-mafia-how-mexican-hackers-stopped-a-93-million-fraud/).
