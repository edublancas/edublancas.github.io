Hi, this is Eduardo. I'm Currently pursuing a M.S in Data Science at Columbia University and working as Research Assistant in [Professor Liam Paninki's Lab](http://grossmancenter.columbia.edu/) in the Neuroscience and Statistics department. I'm interested in Machine Learning, Bayesian Inference and Computational Neuroscience.

Before Moving to NY, I did the Applied Statistics program at UNAM-IIMAS and served as *Lead Backend Engineer* at [Krieger](https://krieger.mx/) in Mexico City.

I also spent a wonderful time in Chicago. I was a *Data Science Fellow* in the [Center for Data Science and Public Policy](http://dsapp.org/) at University of Chicago where I worked in Data Science projects applied to [urban revitalization](http://dssg.uchicago.edu/2015/08/13/infonavit-abandonment.html).

Before that, I obtained my B.S. degree in Mechatronics Engineering from Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey. I was doing iOS development back then and I had the opportunity to work on some amazing [projects](http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/14/bringing-down-the-mexican-mafia-how-mexican-hackers-stopped-a-93-million-fraud/).

You can learn more about my projects in the [projects section](projects.html).
