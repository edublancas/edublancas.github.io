Hi, this is Eduardo! I'm currently working on [Ploomber](https://github.com/ploomber/ploomber), an open-source framework to write maintainable, production-ready pipelines from Jupyter. Check out more about the project on our [website](https://ploomber.io/).

Until the end of 2021, I was a Data Scientist at Fidelity Investments (Boston), where I deployed the first customer-facing Machine Learning model for asset management. In 2019, I obtained an M.S in Data Science from Columbia University, supported by Fulbright. There, I worked as Research Assistant in [Professor Liam Paninki's Lab](http://grossmancenter.columbia.edu/) in the Neuroscience and Statistics department.

Before graduate school, I spent a year in Chicago. I was a Data Science Fellow in the [Center for Data Science and Public Policy](http://dsapp.org/) at The University of Chicago, where I worked on Data Science projects applied to [urban revitalization](http://dssg.uchicago.edu/2015/08/13/infonavit-abandonment.html).

In 2015, I obtained a B.S. degree in Mechatronics Engineering from Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey. I was doing iOS development back then and had the opportunity to work on some fantastic [initiatives](http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/14/bringing-down-the-mexican-mafia-how-mexican-hackers-stopped-a-93-million-fraud/).
