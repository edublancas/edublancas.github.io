I'm a Mechatronics Engineer (that's what my diploma says) born and raised in Mexico City. I did iOS development for a while and now I turned to Data Science. I enjoy applying my technical skills to problems with social impact.

Like the time that I helped to [stop a 9.3 million fraud](http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/14/bringing-down-the-mexican-mafia-how-mexican-hackers-stopped-a-93-million-fraud/). Or when I worked in a project to understand the [causes of home abandonment in Mexico](http://dssg.uchicago.edu/2015/08/13/infonavit-abandonment.html) with some cool folks.

After getting my B.S. degree, I moved to the [Center for Data Science and Public Policy](http://dsapp.org/) at The University of Chicago where I was a *Data Science Fellow*.

In 2016, I moved back home to do the Applied Statistics program at UNAM-IIMAS and served as *Lead Backend Engineer* at [Krieger](https://krieger.mx/).

I'm now based in New York, NY. Currently pursuing a M.S in Data Science at Columbia University and working as Research Assistant in [Professor Liam Paninki's Lab](http://grossmancenter.columbia.edu/) in the Neuroscience and Statistics department. I'm interested in Interpretable Machine Learning, AutoML, Deep Learning and Computational Neuroscience.
