Professional Experience
-----------------------

**Columbia University (Grossman Center for the Statistics of Mind)** \hfill New York, NY

*Research Assistant (Advisor: Liam Paninski)* \hfill Sep 2017 - Present

* Apply novel Machine Learning tecniques to advance the spike sorting state-of-the-art
* Develop a fully automated spike sorting software library to analyze data from dense multielectrode arrays using Python, scikit-learn and Tensorflow

**Krieger** \hfill Mexico City, MX

*Lead Backend Engineer* \hfill Jun 2016 - Aug 2017

* Oversaw backend development across projects to ensure code quality, performance and reliability
* Developed internal software tools that are used in several ongoing projects (input validation, software versioning, deployment, user permissions). These tools have reduced development time and increased team's productivity
